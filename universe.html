            <p>The universe is comprised of an unknown number of planets that propagate through it. We say unknown because most of them are undiscovered though they exist while the known ones still contain current unravelled mystries. Only a few planets neighboring  our own planet 'earth' are within the grasp of our researchers. Our planet resides in the solar system which contains eight officially recognised planets.<p>

              There are also dwarf planets such as pluto which are basicslly too small to retain the title as a planet hence the corresponding title

              Exoplanets are planets that orbit other stars apart from the sun in our solar system. To date, more than 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered and are considered "confirmed."

              <p>Stars are huge celestial bodies made mostly of hydrogen and helium that produce light and heat from the churning nuclear forges inside their cores. Stars can have bodies orbiting them such as sun which is orbitted by the planets, asteroids, satelites etc.

                In the milky way galaxy scientists say there are atleast 100 - 200 billion stars. Other galaxies are considered to have the same range or more.

              <p>Galaxies are vast cosmic islands of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity.If we made the most straightforward estimate using today's best technology, we'd state there are 170 billion galaxies in our Universe. But we know more than that, and our modern estimate is even grander: two trillion galaxies. To state some examples</p>

      Supercluster, a group of galaxy clusters typically consisting of 3 to 10 clusters and spanning as many as 200,000,000 light-years. The first definite supercluster was mapped out by Stephen Gregory, Laird Thompson, and William Tifft in the 1970s. They found the Coma Supercluster extending about 100 million light-years.</p>
              <p>
                The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy group (which contains more than 54 galaxies), which in turn is part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is part of the Laniakea Supercluster.

              <p>
                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from it.In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.
              </p>
              <p>
                Black holes of stellar mass form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.

              <p>
                In March 2021, the EHT Collaboration presented, for the first time, a polarized-based image of the black hole which may help better reveal the forces giving rise to quasars
